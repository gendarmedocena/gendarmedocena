					<h1>UX Research</h1>
					<p>From January to March of 2018, I was a UX Researcher in a class called "Interaction Design" (Cogs 120 at UC San Diego). I teamed up with 2 classmates to build a user-friendly app using design technologies. I learned techniques for rapidly prototyping and evaluating multiple interface alternatives-- and why rapid prototyping and comparative evaluation are essential to excellent interaction design. Here's the data we collected, along with the final piece to the project!<br/><br/><br/>

								<h2>Experience Prototyping
								</h2>
							</header></center>
							<center><i><h4>What was your prototype idea?<br/>
							What were the steps required for planning and what was included in the execution task?</h4></i></center>
							<p>The app idea I am testing is to give suggestions on learning vocabulary words and school-material effectively. This app is designed to help students create efficient learning habits. Today, students often use apps that purposely trains them to memorize vocabulary words, read information passively, and gain minimal knowledge. The steps required for planning this prototype were to: open the app, click the button “start” and read through each button’s learning category (PDF textbook, flashcards, news, images, and notes). After deciding which learning category the first user desires to use, he or she will begin learning their subject.
							</p>
							<center><i><h4>How successful was the execution?<br/>
							Give feedback from users after each experience prototype.</h4></i></center>
							<p>For my first user, the student was someone who is studious and would like to find the most efficient ways to learn his subjects for the quarter. He knows that there are ways besides carrying a textbook everywhere and memorizing terms and definitions. I had him use the app and conclusively, it was somewhat successful. There was one conflict that dealt with the use of the PDF textbook because it was not available. Donne explained that he needed to download a PDF app that would allow him to view the document. This was a valuable issue to note because Donne did not have sufficient data to download another app. I asked Donne, “Despite the dysfunctionality of the textbook, how was the general experience of using the other learning categories?” He also provided me with insight and said, “I think the general usage for each learning category is great. However, add some ways for users to interact with the app, not just to read and take notes passively.” </p>

							<center><i><h4>What adjustments did you make as the facilitator after your first prototype and why? <br/>What were the differences between your first experience prototype and the second? <br/>Which one was more successful and why?</h4></i></center>
							<p>As the facilitator, one adjustment I made was removing the need to download a PDF app for the textbook usage. Instead, I allowed the textbook information to be seen 
on the app they are already on. Overall, this would make the textbook efficient to open but difficult to navigate through other categories of the app. I also provided one matching and racing game to time users on their learning and testing methods. After going through my first user with my app, I noticed how he was easily able to find open gaps for improvement.</p>
							<center><i><h4>How successful was the execution? What was not?<br/>Give feedback from users after each experience prototype.</h4></i></center>
							<p>For my second user, Tim is someone who needs visual diagrams to learn the vocabulary words he is working on in his neuroanatomy and physiology class. I offered him the app to use and it was also somewhat successful. Tim did not comment on the textbook or interactive components of the app but he wishes he could access his camera on his phone to take pictures of his class-diagrams and upload them on his phone. He does not want to type out or draw all his notes on the app when he already has them on paper from class. I thought this was a great idea. It gives users an extra pathway to use information that they have already gathered and store it in a technological device.</p>
							<center><i><h4> What did you learn from doing the experience prototype and how will you apply the knowledge to your app?<br/></h4></i></center>
							<p>From doing the experience prototype, one thing I learned was vastness of opportunity to improve user experiences. If I continued to seek more users to participate in my app, I believe I would have more need-findings and ways to improve my app. I will keep notes of the feedback I received and hope to seek more opportunities for improving my app. Overall, I think my second prototype was more successful because Tim did not find any issue with the textbook or interactive components. However, he opened my eyes to more opportunity in improving my app through enabling the camera use for it.  </p>

							<p>Quizlet is the most educational app to use for flash cards. It is an inspiring app that allows users to organize their information into an online site. It would have greater utility if it incorporated more communication with others who use this app.</p>
							<p>The New York Times is an American newspaper based in New York City. It is indeed an inspiration because if users research a specific topic, there are other news articles that are shown for additional interest. New York Times seeks to give users accurate and recent information of the world today. </p>
							<p>Youtube is a video-sharing website that people use around the world. This social media app engages users by allowing them to watch videos, make comments, and share their feelings 
about specific topics. This creates local and world wide communities who have common interests.</p>

								<h2>Revisiting the Brief // Development Plan
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p>POV: Today, people tend to engage in large amounts of activity and immediate goals to attend to everyday. But how are they in managing and organizing those activities? These people need ways to organize the boring, motivating, happy, and low moments so that their lives would be more relaxed, structured, and healthier.</p>  
							<p>User base: We think the main user base for our app will be individuals who enjoy preplanning and improving their time management. Whether it's for casual hang outs, work activities, or vacations, time management and reflection is one way we interpreted the studio brief, "Removing Barriers to Learning. Core interaction: The core interaction of our app, "ManageMotif," is for the users to organize their plans in a journal. There are many people who use journals today for writing, but the purpose of this app is to journal the big and small events of life through videos and pictures.</p>  
							<p>The idea is that once the user has thought out their plans for the next number of days, weeks, and months, he or she will then have decisions to interact with others by inviting or notifying them about an event. Through the participations and interactions, this is one way to remove barriers to learning-- by having scheduled plans, communities can efficiently build each other up and manage time</p>
