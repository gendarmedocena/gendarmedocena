					<h1><strong>Interaction Design - Cogs 120</strong><br/></h1>
					<h1>UX Researcher // Designer</h1>
					<p>From January 2018 to March of 2018, I was a UX Researcher & Designer in a class called "Interaction Design" (<strong><a href="https://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/COGS.html">Cogs 120 at UC San Diego</a></strong>). I teamed up with 2 classmates to build a user-friendly app using design technologies. I learned techniques for rapidly prototyping and evaluating multiple interface alternatives-- and why rapid prototyping and comparative evaluation are essential to excellent interaction design. Here's the data we collected, along with the final user-friendly app we developed called, <strong><i>ManageMotif</i>!</strong><br/>

								<h2>Experience Prototyping
								</h2>
							</header>
							<i><h4>What was your prototype idea?<br/>
							What were the steps required for planning and what was included in the execution task?</h4></i>
							<p1>The app idea I am testing is to give suggestions on learning vocabulary words and school-material effectively. This app is designed to help students create efficient learning habits. Today, students often use apps that purposely trains them to memorize vocabulary words, read information passively, and gain minimal knowledge. The steps required for planning this prototype were to: open the app, click the button “start” and read through each button’s learning category (PDF textbook, flashcards, news, images, and notes). After deciding which learning category the first user desires to use, he or she will begin learning their subject.
							</p1>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<i><h4>How successful was the execution?<br/>
							Give feedback from users after each experience prototype.</h4></i>
							<p1>For my first user, the student was someone who is studious and would like to find the most efficient ways to learn his subjects for the quarter. He knows that there are ways besides carrying a textbook everywhere and memorizing terms and definitions. I had him use the app and conclusively, it was somewhat successful. There was one conflict that dealt with the use of the PDF textbook because it was not available. The student explained that he needed to download a PDF app that would allow him to view the document. This was a valuable issue to note because Donne did not have sufficient data to download another app. I asked him, “Despite the dysfunctionality of the textbook, how was the general experience of using the other learning categories?” He also provided me with insight and said, “I think the general usage for each learning category is great. However, add some ways for users to interact with the app, not just to read and take notes passively.” </p1>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<i><h4>What adjustments did you make as the facilitator after your first prototype and why?<br/>What were the differences between your first experience prototype and the second? <br/>Which one was more successful and why?</h4></i>
							<p1>As the facilitator, one adjustment I made was removing the need to download a PDF app for the textbook usage. Instead, I allowed the textbook information to be seen on the app they are already on. Overall, this would make the textbook efficient to open but difficult to navigate through other categories of the app. I also provided one matching and racing game to time users on their learning and testing methods. After going through my first user with my app, I noticed how he was easily able to find open gaps for improvement.</p1>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<i><h4>How successful was the execution? What was not?<br/>Give feedback from users after each experience prototype.</h4></i>
							<p1>For my second user, the student was someone who needed visual diagrams to learn the vocabulary words he is working on in his neuroanatomy and physiology class. I offered him the app to use and it was also somewhat successful. He did not comment on the textbook or interactive components of the app but he wishes he could access his camera on his phone to take pictures of his class-diagrams and upload them on his phone. He does not want to type out or draw all his notes on the app when he already has them on paper from class. I thought this was a great idea. It gives users an extra pathway to use information that they have already gathered and store it in a technological device.</p1>
							<br/>
							<br/>
							<i><h4> What did you learn from doing the experience prototype?<br/>
							How will you apply the knowledge to your app?<br/></h4></i>
							<br/>
							<p1>From doing the experience prototype, one thing I learned was vastness of opportunity to improve user experiences. If I continued to seek more users to participate in my app, I believe I would have more need-findings and ways to improve my app. I will keep notes of the feedback I received and hope to seek more opportunities for improving my app. Overall, I think my second prototype was more successful because the student did not find any issue with the textbook or interactive components. However, he opened my eyes to more opportunity in improving my app through enabling the camera use for it.</p1>

							<p1>Quizlet is the most educational app to use for flash cards. It is an inspiring app that allows users to organize their information into an online site. It would have greater utility if it incorporated more communication with others who use this app.
							The New York Times is an American newspaper based in New York City. It is indeed an inspiration because if users research a specific topic, there are other news articles that are shown for additional interest. New York Times seeks to give users accurate and recent information of the world today.
							Youtube is a video-sharing website that people use around the world. This social media app engages users by allowing them to watch videos, make comments, and share their feelings about specific topics. This creates local and world wide communities who have common interests.</p2>

								<h2>Revisiting the Brief // Development Plan
								</h2>
							</header>		
							<p1>Point of View: Today, people engage in large amounts of activity and immediate goals to attend to everyday. But how are they in managing and organizing those activities? These people need ways to organize the boring, motivating, happy, and low moments so that their lives would be more relaxed, structured, and healthier.
							User base: We thought the main user base for our app would be individuals who enjoyed preplanning and improving their time management. Whether it was for casual hang outs, work activities, or vacations, time management and reflection was one way we interpreted the studio brief, "Removing Barriers to Learning. The core interaction of our app, <i>ManageMotif</i>, was for users to organize their plans in a journal. There are many people who use journals today for writing, but the purpose of this app was to journal the big and small events of life through videos and pictures.  
							The overall idea was that once the user has thought out their plans for the next number of days, weeks, and months, he or she will then have decisions to interact with others by inviting or notifying them about an event. Through the participations and interactions, this was one way to remove barriers to learning-- by having scheduled plans, communities can efficiently build each other up and manage time.</p1>

								<li><strong>Login</strong></li>
									
										<p>1. When users open the web application, they were taken to the login page.</p>
										<p>2. Users had three options. They could login to the page through: logging in with a personal account, signing up, or logging into their facebook account. This allowed them to turn to the next page.</p>
									
								<li><strong>After logging in, choose 1 of 3 tasks..</strong></li>
									<ul>1. Users can click “Create Event” button. 
										<p>- Users fill out information about their event (name, time, location, and importance)</p>
										<p>- The more important event will appear larger on the main page.</p>
										<p>- After entering the information, they should can click “back” to return to the task page.</>
									</ul>
									<ul>2. Users can type in the “Quick Reminder” input box
									<li>- Allows users to enter information for reminders about their schedule </li>
									<li>- After filling out, they can click “ok” to update main page.</li> 
									</ul>
								<ul>3. Users can click “Delete event” button. 
									<li>- After filling out, users can delete it if they desire.</li>
									<li>- If events are shown on main page, users must click on event and then click “Delete” button.</li>

							<ul><center><strong>Consent Form:</strong>
								<p>Before testing, we (the facilitators) thanked the participants for volunteering. We provided a set of instructions for participants to read and ask for their consent. After, participants signed the consent form and tried the user friendly app.</p></center>
							</ul>

							<ol><center><strong>Recorded Observations</strong>
							<li>1. During the user testing, we allowed the user to use the app without guidance.</li>
							<li>2. We took notes during user testing.</li>
							<li>3. We applied Google Analytics to trace the user’s actions.</li>
							</ol>
						</center>

							<ul><center><strong>Script</strong>
							<p>This is a small script we wrote for our users to agree and sign for their consent.</p>
							<li>“Welcome! Thank you for volunteering to test our application, ​ManageMotif, we really appreciate it. The purpose of this test is to evaluate our application. We are asking you to test our application so that we can investigate the way it works and needs improvement. As you use our application, we want you to think out loud and explain to us what you are trying to do. We ask for your complete honesty about the work we have done. Before we begin, please read and sign this consent form!”  </li>
							</ul></center>

							<ol><center><strong>No Bias</strong>
							<p>The instructions and the script do not present any bias. It is not directing the volunteer in any direction. The script is very broad and it is only asking the participant to think out loud while using our application. We did not ask for any specific feedback.</p>
							</center>
							</ol>

							<center><ol><strong>3 Main Questions & Design Choices</strong>
							<li>1. Will the user invite people to their event(s)?</li>
							<li>2. Will the user find our application aesthetically & functionallity pleasing?</li>
							<li>3. Will the uesr be excited to schedule all the major and minor events to this app?</li>

							<p><strong>Why did you choose these people to test?</strong></p>
							<p>We chose our <i>first participant</i> because she cares about time management and the ways she plans her days for the week. One thing about her was that doesn’t know how to commit her them. We thought this app would be a great fit for her because the purpose of our application is to motivate users to schedule their appointments, plans, and goals.</p>
							<p>Our <i>second particular subject </i>was chosen because he was a student who was commited to school, sports, and club events. Students like him need accessible way to timemanage their appointments.</p>

							<h3>Participant 1</h3>
							<ul>
									<li>- She loaded the website and she clicked the “skip and go to main page</li>
									<li>- She was confused as to why there were multiple events preplanned</li>
									<li>- She started by attempting to click on random things to see what was clickable and what wasn’t. </li>
									<li>- She found the add event page and started making an event she had during her week.  </li>
									<li>- After clicking add event she liked how the event was displayed on the main page </li>
									<li>- Next, she decided to click add event again and entering her information, she decided to delete it. </li>
									<li>- She comments how she wishes there would be a pop up showing “Are you sure you want to delete this event?” </li>

							<h3>Participant 2</h3>
							<ul>
							<li>- Was very clear on what to do when logging in. This was the main success.</li>
							<li>- On the main page there was a breakdown, after the login the participant did not know what to do. They also did not have any idea what this web application was about. </li>
							<li>- The participant was then drawn towards the create Event button. It was when the form on the next page popped up that they understood the purpose of the application. This was a success, but could have been achieved earlier. </li>
							<li>- The participant was writing a very long comment inside the textfield. They were not able to view all of the writing they had entered, because the textfield was too small. </li>
							<li>- When they clicked either the delete button or edit button, they webserver was unable to retrieve the page. So key functionality was missing. </li>
							<li>- The user as clearly irritated that they faced this barrier towards their goal, they were unable to go back within their device.</li>
							<li>- There was no description of what to do.</li>
							<li>- The text fields were quite small and the user had to be very specific with where they aimed, making the use quite slow. </li>
							<li>- The user was confused with the rating system (in stars) and how to enter the date. The user took about ten seconds to realise that they had to enter numbers in the field, it was un intuitive. It was also possible to set past events from the form inside an event scheduling application.</li>
							<li>- Lack of error page informing the user what the problems in the app were. And difficult to recover from errors when not all the fields were entered.</li>

							<i><h4>Summaries & Reflections <br/>
							</h4></i>
							
						</center>

							<ul><center>
								<p>Both participants thought the app was flexible and very easy to use. It had a clean design. At the sametime, the preplanned boxes confused them. They were unsure what the page was about. At first glance, the level of importance was not noticeable and while using the app, there were functionality bugs that was missing their goal. Overall, the participants claim that there was not a clear purpose about the app.</p>
								<p>For us, as the designers, we realized this was a major problem and needed to be improved or users will be easily uninterested, thus will not use the app.</p></center>
							</ul>
<!--
							<ol><center><strong>A list changes needed..</strong>
							<li>- Implemented a description on each page (e.g. explain how the importance scheme works).</li>
							<li>- Changed colors on each event box to determine level of interest and happiness.</li>
							<li>- Built a notification box to let users know about their added or deleted event. - Support inside the app helping to guide the users actions. </li>
							<li>- Changes to the form, make text areas inside the right places, so they can read through their own comments.</li>
							<li>- Replaced the star system with something easier to understand such as high and low priority. </li>
							<li>- Implemented a drop down calendar to set upcoming dates and replaced their keyboard to type in the numbers, forgiving if the user mistypes more. </li>
							</ol>
						</center>

							<ul><center><strong>3 general patterns we found in tester behavior..</strong>
							<li>1. Users tried to click on event blocks on the main page and that lead them to the event details page</li>
							<li>2. Users did not always log in, they skipped to the next page</li>
							<li>3. Users expected a confirmation notice when they accidentally deleted or added an event.</li>

								<h2>Google Analytics // Statistical Reviews</h2>

							<p>We recruited our users by selecting people who schedule their work, study, and social lives through either paper reminders or any kind of mobile app. Our targeted demographic was the group of people who enjoy planning and taking care of time management.</p>
							<p><strong>Identifying & Tabling User Behavior</strong></p>
							<p>Clicks on back button meant the interaction flow was interrupted. A large number of back button clicks indicated the version was not good. Our default expectation was that version A and B are as good as each other.</p>
							<p>Overall, our online testing was opened from March 4th to March 8th and we received data from 25 users. Among the 25 users, 12 were assigned to design A and 13 were assigned to design B. For those who tested our design A, we calculated an average of 3.5 back-button clicks. For those who tested our design B, we calculated an average of 2.07 back-button clicks. By looking at the behavior of each design used, it is clear that the majority of users did not spend much time on the app, but instead just created a number of events. Although this did not influence our experiment in any direction, we were only comparing users’ actions between back-button clicks. The results may reflect the potential improvement for a more user-friendly app. Because users could not leave comments in our prototype during the online testing, we did not receive any qualitative data to interpret and learn from.</p>
							<p><strong>Any changes you have made or would like to make to your prototype?</strong></p>
							<p>The users were repeatedly clicking on the areas after they completed a section in a non linear way, on the form page, according to our results. This was a clear indication that appeared to have an unforgiving set of buttons and text areas, so we made the widgets on the form larger. People spent an inordinate amount of time on the time table.</p>
							<p><strong>What did you learn from A/B Testing via Google Analytics?</strong></p>
							<p>We learned that there was a substantial sampling bias that has affected the mundane              realism of our results. We also learned that it is very easy to get a large sample quickly and that some of this revealed far more subtle interface problems, such as the number of times people were pressing the back button, but not the actual difficulties that people have.</p>
							<p>We also learned that 10% of users returned to our A test, and B test. This maybe because for those that returned, there may have been something that they enjoyed. For the 90% that did not return it may have been frivolous or become an indicator of difficulties in navigation and visual                unattractiveness. This warranted further investigation.</p>
							<p>We looked into how people were navigating back, and it seemed fine. However on A people were returning. There were two main differences. On A you were lead straight to the add event page. On B you saw your schedule first. Also the backgrounds were different. B was more subtle. So we learned that navigation and visuals may have been affecting user responses.</p>
